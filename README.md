# vogels_group_rotation_project

This repository comprises all the reasonable jupyther notebooks I produced during my internship at Vogels group at ISTA. The report write up is available at https://www.overleaf.com/read/mgntgtqkjqtv#b04397

## The project
I am building upon the work of Richard Gao et al. [Deep inverse modeling reveals dynamic-dependent invariances in neural circuit mechanisms] https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.21.608969v1
I started from code available at the corresponding [github page] https://github.com/mackelab/automind/tree/main and worked with the [Demo-1] and helped to create [Demo-2] after finding bugs in Demo-1 when I tried to use it with my own raw dataset. In Demo-2 we added targeting a real experimental recording. Specifically, we want to discover circuit models that can reproduce a multi-electrode array recording from the organoid dataset.
